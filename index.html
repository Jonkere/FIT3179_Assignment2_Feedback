<h1 style="color: red;"> Magpies and Swooping in Australia</h1>
<div id="vis1"></div>
</br>
<p style="font-size: large;"> As we can see, there is an abundance of magpies in Australia.</br> Now magpies are a fairly aggressive species, which leads us to find that in Australia, there is also an abundance of injuries resulting from magpies swooping.</p>
<div id="vis2"></div>
</br>
<p style="font-size: large;">We see that most of the people that get swooped are cyclists, followed by people playing or engaging in recreation.</br> So we can see that if you don't want to get swooped by a magpie, then be slow and careful: whizzing down the road on a bicycle is a lot more likely to get you swooped than walking calmly down the road.</p>
